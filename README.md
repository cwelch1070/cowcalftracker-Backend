# TODO
- Add default for calf fields
- Decide on way to display calves to user
- Consider deleting previous calf or adding it to a "History" document
- Consider if displaying the gender only is sufficient on cattle card or more info is needed
- Limit calf gender options to only two, Bull or Heifer
- Reimplement role call feature (Add to drop down for each herd on herd page)

# Other Needed Changes
- Implement thrid party auth
- Added more logging 
- Track user logins
- Implement email notifications for cattle updates

# Feature Ideas
- Create a chore/Todo portion of the app that works like the Jira software
- The user can create and share todo's that need to be done like feeding, watering, pull calves or anthing farm or ranch related
- Basically Jira for farmers
- May work best as a seperate app with integration into cowcalftracker?
